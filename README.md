- The tool helps the staff to analyse and visualise the student feedback data about engineering courses through topic modelling, text mining and opinion mining.
- The application was developed in Python.
- The application runs on Google Colab and can be accessed from the following link: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/126ykrAosZIhkzC9r5m-jkY9UevgjtP0I
- Execute all the steps from 1 to 5 before application starts.


# Demo

- The student feedback data from a prominent university in India was analysed with the help of the tool. The data is available on Kaggle and can be downloaded from the link https://www.kaggle.com/brarajit18/student-feedback-dataset/downloads/student-feedback-dataset.zip/1

- Download the data and run the application on Google Colab. Run all the cells from 1 to 5 in the colab notebook.
- Once application starts executing, import the feedback data. Note: the application only accepts .xls file (data in excel file format)
